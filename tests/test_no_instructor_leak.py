"""The distribution guard: prove this bundle carries no scored-round material.

This repository is PUBLIC and 100+ people clone it. The scored round runs
on briefs nobody outside the instructor's machine has seen, and a single
leaked question, claim or verdict invalidates that round for everyone at
once — retroactively, with no way to recall the copies. So the boundary
gets a test rather than a convention, and the test runs in the student
bundle where the mistake would actually land.

Four things are checked, in increasing order of subtlety.

1. NO INSTRUCTOR TREE. No `instructor/` directory, no `briefs_private.json`,
   no `reference/` package: the five reference layer implementations, the
   oracle, the adversary harness and the scored briefs all live there.
2. NO IMPORT OF ONE. A test or script that says `from instructor.reference
   import ...` is either shipping the answer key or crashing on every
   student machine. Both are release blockers, and the second is how the
   first usually gets noticed too late.
3. NO SCORED BRIEF IDS. The scored set numbers its briefs `prv-NN-...`;
   that pattern appears nowhere in a clean bundle.
4. NO SCORED BRIEF TEXT — the one that actually needs a technique.

THE TECHNIQUE, AND WHY IT IS NOT PLAINTEXT
==========================================

A leak test that shipped the secrets it looks for would BE the leak. So
nothing here stores any scored brief's text. At build time, the packaging
step read the private brief file and reduced every question, claim,
key term, verdict phrase, verdict id, brief id, refined query and
instructor note to the set of its 6-word n-grams ("shingles"), normalised
(NFC, casefolded, word characters only), then stored a salted, truncated
SHA-256 of each in `tests/private_fingerprints.json`. Recovering a
sentence from those is a preimage attack per n-gram; matching one is a
set intersection. The test recomputes shingles for every text file in the
tree and intersects.

Shingles rather than whole-string hashes, because a leak is rarely a
whole file: someone pastes ONE question into a docstring while debugging.
An n-gram catches the fragment; a whole-string hash would not.

WHY THERE ARE TWO TIERS
=======================

The scored briefs quote the corpus, and the corpus ships. A scored
brief's `claim` IS a verbatim line of some `data/corpus/doc-XXXX.json`,
by construction — that is not a leak, that is the lab working. What
distinguishes a leak from the corpus doing its job is WHERE the sentence
appears.

* `tier_all` — n-grams that occur in the private set and NOWHERE in this
  bundle: questions, verdict phrases, brief ids, refined queries,
  instructor notes. Any occurrence, in any file, is a leak. The set is
  computed as a DIFFERENCE against the shipped bundle, so shared
  boilerplate ("Trong kỳ báo cáo, ...") is subtracted rather than
  producing a false alarm — what is left is what is unique to the scored
  set.
* `tier_prose` — n-grams of the scored CLAIMS and key terms that are not
  already elsewhere in the bundle. These are checked everywhere EXCEPT
  `data/corpus/`, whose documents are the sentences' legitimate home.

Both tiers are empty-by-construction on the bundle as built: if either
were non-empty at build time the packaging step would have failed. So a
failure here always means something changed after packaging.

WHAT THIS TEST CANNOT DO
========================
It cannot catch a paraphrase, and it cannot catch a leak expressed as
code (a script that reconstructs a scored brief from the corpus). It is a
tripwire on the most likely accident — copy-paste — not a proof of
secrecy. The proof is that `instructor/` was never copied in the first
place, which is what tests 1 and 2 pin.
